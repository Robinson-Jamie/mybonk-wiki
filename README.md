What is MY₿ONK? 
----

What is commonly referred to as "*bitcoin full node distribution*" or simply "*full node*" is a set of software more or less related to bitcoin put together in such a way that it makes the experience of installing it and operating it as smooth and secure as possible.


Most full node distributions are great to experiment and learn. 

We want to inject a fresh approach and perspective into the mix with our cumulative experience.
We focus on security-first, stripped bitcoin-only stack referred to as the "[MY₿ONK stack](/docs/MYBONK_stack.md)", or simply MY₿ONK.

MY₿ONK is alpha software. Use on SIGNET ([what is Signet?](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Signet)) instead of MAINNET for now; This is set in in MY₿ONK console's configuration.nix via ```services.bitcoind.regtest=true;```. Bookmark [Signet block explorer](https://mempool.space/signet).

Like most bitcoin full node distributions is it **possible** to run MY₿ONK on a variety of hardware or virtual machines, but it would be impossible to keep up with all the various more or less suitable hardware one can find on the market. MY₿ONK community focus on MY₿ONK console, feel free to run the code on any other hardware or virtual machine but we are not in a capacity to provide any support in that case as our objective is precisely to abstract the recurring hardware issues observed on other platforms.
