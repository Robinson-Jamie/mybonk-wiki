## Other tools
- [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd): Small command-line tool that will wrap an existing command-line interface program, and allow it to be accessed via a WebSocket. WebSocket-capable applications can now be built very easily. As long as you can write an executable program that reads STDIN and writes to STDOUT, you can build a WebSocket server. No networking libraries necessary.
- [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator): Tool that allows you to easily manage tmux sessions by using yaml files to describe the layout of a tmux session, and open up that session with a single command.
