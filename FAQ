# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions




## Installation
### Can I install MYBONK stack on another hardware than console than MYBONK console?
100%. 
Although MYBONK console has been designed specifically as a bitcoin-only full node with price, performance, durability, portability energy-efficience, supply chain resilience and generic parts in mind you can run the software stack on whatever hardware you deem suitable for purpose. 
However we focus our efforts at maintaining the code base with MYBONK console as hardware reference (it would be impossible to support all the possible hardware forms and shapes available on the market at any given time.
Running a MYBONK console allows you to be confident your system is identical to the one of the other MYBONK user, you won't be slow-down by some sort of compatibility issues or missing drivers, you just don't have the required skills or the time, you want it to work from the get go.

### How to verify a file or image downloaded from the Internet?
This is important if you are a MYBONK hacker (operators and 'standard' users) don't need this.
There are all sorts of risks and threats associated with files and images download form the Internet. 
"Don't trust verify". This can be done by verifying the data in two ways: verify its hash (proves integrity) or verify its signature (proves integrity and authenticity)
You can use the command 'shasum' to verify that the sha256 hash, it must return the same hash as the one provided my the originator (often mentioned next to the download link).

```
shasum -a 256 [THE-FILE-YOU-DOWNLOADED]
```

Verifying a sha256 hash proves integrity but not authenticity.

To verify authenticity (proove that the legitimate source signed it) you can use 'gpg' to import the source bublic key:

```
curl --tlsv1.2 --proto '=https' https://keybase.io/mybonk/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
```

And run a verification on the data using the source's signature file.

```
gpg --verify [SIGNATURE-FILE] [THE-FILE-YOU-DOWNLOADED]
```

*You can ignore any warning about the key being 'not a trusted signature' or untrusted .. as long you see "good signature" and the correct main & sub fingerprints the download is valid.*
